# NFL Confidence Pool Simulator - Research Questions & Ideas

## Data Analysis Questions

### Q1: Probability Calibration
**Question**: Are The Odds API probabilities well-calibrated against actual NFL outcomes?

**Test**:
- Compare predicted win probabilities vs actual outcomes (Weeks 1-4+)
- Bucket games by probability: 50-60%, 60-70%, 70-80%, 80-90%, 90%+
- Check if 70% favorites actually win ~70% of the time
- Look for systematic bias (e.g., favorites overvalued, home teams overvalued)

**Implementation**:
```python
def validate_probability_calibration(historical_games, predicted_probs):
    """
    Compare predicted probabilities vs actual outcomes.
    Returns calibration curve and suggested adjustments.
    """
    buckets = {
        '50-60%': {'predicted': [], 'actual': []},
        '60-70%': {'predicted': [], 'actual': []},
        '70-80%': {'predicted': [], 'actual': []},
        '80-90%': {'predicted': [], 'actual': []},
        '90%+': {'predicted': [], 'actual': []}
    }

    for game, prob in zip(historical_games, predicted_probs):
        bucket = get_bucket(prob)
        buckets[bucket]['predicted'].append(prob)
        buckets[bucket]['actual'].append(1 if game.favorite_won else 0)

    # Calculate actual win rate per bucket
    for bucket in buckets.values():
        bucket['actual_win_rate'] = sum(bucket['actual']) / len(bucket['actual'])
        bucket['predicted_win_rate'] = sum(bucket['predicted']) / len(bucket['predicted'])
        bucket['calibration_error'] = bucket['actual_win_rate'] - bucket['predicted_win_rate']

    return buckets
```

**Impact**:
- If miscalibrated, adjust probabilities before confidence assignment
- Could change confidence ordering and improve expected value
- Example: If 70% favorites only win 65%, compress probabilities toward 50%

---

### Q2: Strategy Performance Tracking
**Question**: Which strategy actually performs best week-to-week with real outcomes?

**Test**:
- After each week completes, calculate what each strategy would have scored
- Track running performance: Chalk vs Slight-Contrarian vs Aggressive vs Random-MidShuffle
- Identify weeks where contrarian outperformed and analyze why

**Implementation**:
```python
def weekly_postmortem(week):
    """
    After week completes:
    1. Load actual game outcomes
    2. Load our strategy predictions (saved JSON files)
    3. Calculate points scored by each strategy
    4. Compare to actual field performance
    5. Update running performance metrics
    """

    strategies = ['chalk', 'slight', 'aggress', 'shuffle']
    results = {}

    for strategy in strategies:
        picks = load_predictions(week, strategy)
        points = calculate_points_from_outcomes(picks, outcomes)
        results[strategy] = points

    # Compare to field
    field_avg = calculate_field_average(week)

    return {
        'week': week,
        'strategy_performance': results,
        'field_average': field_avg,
        'best_strategy': max(results, key=results.get)
    }
```

**Impact**:
- Validate Monte Carlo predictions against reality
- Identify if one strategy consistently outperforms
- Build confidence in recommendations or flag issues

---

### Q3: Contrarian Opportunity Validation
**Question**: Do the contrarian opportunities identified by our analyzer actually work?

**Test**:
- For Weeks 1-4, run contrarian analyzer with actual field data
- Identify games that met criteria (>75% consensus, >35% upset prob, >0 EV)
- Check actual outcomes: Did those contrarian picks win?
- Calculate actual EV vs predicted EV

**Example** (from Phase 2 summary):
- Week 4: JAC over SF (97% consensus on SF, JAC won) → +8.00 EV ✓
- Week 4: PIT over MIN (81% consensus on MIN, PIT won) → +6.00 EV ✓
- Sample size: 2/2 successful, but need more data

**Impact**:
- Validates contrarian analyzer methodology
- Helps calibrate EV thresholds (when to actually take contrarian picks)
- Informs two-phase approach decision

---

## Philosophical Strategy Questions

### Q4: Confidence Assignment Philosophy
**Current Approach**: Chalk strategy = pure probability order (highest prob → confidence 13)

**Question**: Is this optimal given field behavior?

**Consideration**:
- If field also uses probability order (historical data suggests they do)
- High correlation in top picks (everyone picks DET 13, BUF 12, etc.)
- When chalk picks lose, EVERYONE loses together → less differentiation
- Is there value in reducing correlation with field?

**Alternative Philosophies**:

1. **Anti-Correlation Approach** (already tested: Random-MidShuffle)
   - Shuffle confidence 4-10 to reduce correlation with field
   - Historical performance: 0.8 pts worse than Chalk (66.7 vs 67.5)
   - **Tentative conclusion**: Correlation isn't a major issue

2. **Kelly Criterion-Inspired**
   - Assign confidence based on **edge vs field**, not just probability
   - Example: DET is 81% favorite, field gives it avg confidence 12.6
   - Your edge is minimal → consider lower confidence?
   - Save high confidence for games where you have informational advantage
   - Formula: `confidence ∝ (your_prob - field_implied_prob) × kelly_fraction`

3. **Inverse Field Confidence**
   - Idea: High prob + Low field confidence = Your high confidence
   - Reduces correlation in outcomes (when favorites lose, field loses less)
   - Example: If 75% favorite but field only gives it conf 5, you give it conf 12
   - Needs Monte Carlo simulation to test

4. **Expected Value Optimization**
   - Maximize: `Sum(confidence × win_prob × differentiation_from_field)`
   - Not just picking winners, but picking winners differently than field
   - Requires field prediction or actual field data
   - More complex optimization problem

**Next Steps**:
- Implement Kelly-inspired approach and backtest on Weeks 1-4
- Test inverse field confidence with historical data
- Compare to current chalk approach

---

### Q5: Two-Phase Decision Process
**Question**: Should we re-analyze after field picks become available?

**Current Flow**:
```
The Odds API → Probabilities → Monte Carlo vs Simulated Field → Recommendations
```

**Proposed Two-Phase Flow**:
```
Phase 1 (Tuesday AM): Run simulator with historical field composition
                      → Generate baseline picks

Phase 2 (Tuesday PM): Download actual field picks
                      → Run contrarian analyzer
                      → If high-value opportunities (>5 EV, >75% consensus, Low risk)
                      → Consider changing 1-2 picks
```

**Trade-offs**:
- **Pro**: Can exploit actual field behavior, not just historical averages
- **Pro**: Might identify 1-2 high-EV opportunities per season
- **Con**: Adds complexity and decision-making burden
- **Con**: Risk of overthinking and second-guessing baseline picks

**Test**:
- Simulate Phase 2 on Weeks 1-4 with actual field data
- How often would Phase 2 recommend changes?
- Would those changes have improved results?
- What's the historical hit rate?

**Decision Criteria**:
Only implement if historical backtest shows:
- Phase 2 changes recommended ≥3 times in 4 weeks
- Phase 2 changes improved results >60% of the time
- Average improvement >2 points per week

---

### Q6: Field Prediction Model
**Question**: Can we predict opponent picks before they're publicly visible?

**Approach**:
- Train model on Weeks 1-4 to predict each player's Week 5 picks
- Features per game:
  - Team quality metrics (Elo, DVOA, etc.)
  - Home/away
  - Betting spread and total
  - Historical player behavior (contrarian rate, risk tolerance)
- Output: Predicted field consensus per game

**Use Case**:
- Run contrarian analysis with predicted field (instead of waiting for actual)
- Make Phase 1 picks more informed about likely field distribution
- Reduces need for Phase 2 adjustment

**Validation**:
- Test: How well does predicted field match actual field?
- Metric: Mean absolute error in consensus percentages
- Threshold: Only use if MAE < 15% (e.g., predict 70%, actual is 60-80%)

**Complexity vs Value**:
- High engineering effort
- Requires data collection on all opponents
- Benefit likely <1 point per week
- **Recommendation**: Defer until simpler improvements exhausted

---

## System Validation & Feedback Loop

### Q7: Missing Games Detection
**Question**: How do we ensure we have complete game slate?

**Solution**:
```python
def validate_game_slate(games, week):
    """
    Validate we have all expected games for the week.
    """
    expected_games = 14  # Typical week (adjust for byes)
    actual_games = len(games)

    if actual_games < expected_games:
        # Try to identify missing teams
        all_teams = set(NFL_TEAMS)
        teams_in_slate = set()
        for game in games:
            teams_in_slate.add(game['away_team'])
            teams_in_slate.add(game['home_team'])

        missing_teams = all_teams - teams_in_slate

        raise ValidationError(
            f"Expected {expected_games} games, got {actual_games}. "
            f"Missing teams: {missing_teams}. "
            f"Check if games already started or API issues."
        )

    return True
```

**Impact**: Prevents making picks with incomplete data

---

### Q8: Performance Feedback Loop
**Question**: Are we learning and improving over time?

**Proposed Weekly Process**:
1. **Pre-Week**: Run simulator, make picks
2. **Post-Week**: Run postmortem analysis
   - Actual strategy performance vs predictions
   - Probability calibration check
   - Contrarian opportunities identified vs actual outcomes
   - Field behavior vs historical patterns
3. **Learning**: Update understanding
   - Are probabilities well-calibrated? (adjust if not)
   - Is chalk still optimal? (track week-by-week)
   - Did we miss any high-value opportunities?

**Implementation**:
```python
def weekly_learning_cycle(week):
    """
    Complete feedback loop for continuous improvement.
    """
    # Load data
    predictions = load_all_strategy_predictions(week)
    actual_picks = load_actual_picks(week)
    outcomes = load_game_outcomes(week)

    # Analysis
    strategy_performance = evaluate_strategies(predictions, outcomes)
    calibration = check_probability_calibration(predictions, outcomes)
    contrarian_analysis = evaluate_contrarian_opportunities(actual_picks, outcomes)

    # Report
    report = generate_weekly_report({
        'week': week,
        'best_strategy': strategy_performance,
        'calibration_error': calibration,
        'missed_opportunities': contrarian_analysis
    })

    # Update parameters if needed
    if calibration.error > 0.05:
        suggest_probability_adjustment(calibration)

    return report
```

## Open Questions for Data Collection

1. How many weeks until we have statistically significant calibration data? (Need ~50+ games per bucket)
2. What's the variance in weekly strategy performance? (Is one strategy consistently better or just lucky?)
3. How stable is field behavior? (Do opponents change strategies mid-season?)
4. What's the optimal sample size for field composition? (Are 4 weeks enough or need full season?)

---

**Next Actions**:
- Implement Tier 1 items first (game validation, tracking, calibration)
- Collect 4+ more weeks of data before testing philosophical changes
- Revisit Tier 2/3 after establishing baseline performance metrics

---

## "Outside the Box" Ideas

### Q9: Psychological/Behavioral Patterns
**Question**: Do competitors exhibit exploitable psychological biases?

**Potential Patterns**:
1. **Recency Bias**: Do players over-weight last week's results?
   - Example: Team that won big last week → field overvalues this week
   - Analysis: Track team performance Week N vs field consensus Week N+1
   - Exploit: Fade teams on winning streaks if odds don't support it

2. **Home Team Bias**: Do competitors overvalue home teams?
   - Especially for local teams or "home-state" bias
   - Test: Compare field consensus on home teams vs Vegas lines
   - If field systematically overvalues home teams → contrarian road picks

3. **Brand Name Bias**: Do people overvalue "sexy" teams (Chiefs, Cowboys, etc.)?
   - Historical: Cowboys used to have "America's Team" premium
   - Test: Field consensus on brand teams vs actual win probability
   - Exploit: Fade popular teams when overvalued

4. **Loss Aversion in Confidence Assignment**: Do players avoid high confidence on risky picks?
   - Even when EV suggests it, people might under-confidence good bets
   - Look at field confidence distribution vs optimal Kelly betting
   - Opportunity: Be more aggressive on high-probability favorites

5. **Week-to-Week Adjustment Patterns**: How do players react to losses?
   - After losing a high-confidence pick, do they become more conservative?
   - After winning multiple weeks, do they get cocky and take more risks?
   - Track individual player confidence patterns across weeks

**Implementation**:
```python
def analyze_behavioral_patterns(historical_picks, outcomes):
    """
    Detect psychological biases in field behavior.
    """
    patterns = {
        'recency_bias': test_recency_bias(historical_picks, outcomes),
        'home_bias': test_home_team_bias(historical_picks, outcomes),
        'brand_bias': test_brand_team_bias(historical_picks, outcomes),
        'confidence_patterns': analyze_confidence_evolution(historical_picks)
    }
    return patterns
```

### Q10: Time-Based Market Inefficiencies
**Question**: When are odds/probabilities most accurate?

**Hypothesis**: Betting lines move throughout the week as information arrives

**Observations**:
- **Tuesday**: Sharp money settles early, most efficient odds
- **Wednesday-Friday**: Public money moves lines (less informed)
- **Saturday-Sunday**: Last-minute injury news, weather updates

**Strategy Implications**:
1. Use **Tuesday morning odds** for baseline probabilities (most efficient)
2. Check for **late-week line movement** (>2 points) → indicates new information
3. If major movement → investigate reason (injury, weather, etc.)
4. Adjust confidence accordingly

**Example**:
- Tuesday: Lions -6.5 (81% implied)
- Sunday: Lions -3.5 (65% implied) ← Something happened!
- Action: Reduce confidence on Lions or flip to Bengals

**Implementation**:
Track odds snapshots 2-3x per week, flag significant movement

---

### Q11: Correlation in Game Outcomes
**Question**: Are game outcomes correlated? Can we exploit this?

**Potential Correlations**:

1. **Divisional Round-Robin Effects**:
   - If AFC North teams all win in Week 5 → maybe they're undervalued league-wide
   - Inverse: If NFC East all loses Week 1-3 → maybe overvalued Week 4

2. **Time Zone Clustering**:
   - West Coast teams traveling East for 1 PM games (jet lag)
   - East Coast teams traveling West for night games
   - Test: Do these scenarios have predictable win rate impacts?

3. **Weather Correlation**:
   - If multiple games in cold-weather cities → potential for upsets
   - High winds affect passing teams more than rushing teams
   - Rain/snow compresses scores → more randomness → upsets

4. **Referee Tendencies**:
   - Some refs call more penalties (favors underdogs, slows game)
   - Some refs let teams "play" (favors favorites)
   - Data available: Track ref assignments and impact

5. **Narrative Correlation**:
   - "Chalk week" vs "Upset week" clustering
   - After multiple chalk weeks, is an upset week more likely? (regression to mean)
   - Test: Week-level correlation of upsets

**Exploit**:
If you observe early Sunday games trending upset-heavy → adjust late-game confidence

**Problem**: Can't change picks mid-week, so limited utility unless patterns are predictable

---

### Q12: Information Asymmetry Opportunities
**Question**: What information do you have that the field doesn't?

**Potential Edges**:

1. **You Have This Simulator**:
   - Field is guessing at probabilities
   - You have de-vigged, consensus-based probabilities
   - Your edge: More accurate win probability estimates
   - **Question**: Is this actually an edge, or does field use similar data?

2. **Advanced Stats Sources**:
   - DVOA (Football Outsiders)
   - EPA (Expected Points Added) models
   - PFF grades
   - Does the field use these, or just "gut feel"?

3. **Injury Information Timing**:
   - You make picks Tuesday morning
   - Most injury news breaks Wednesday-Saturday
   - **Problem**: You're disadvantaged by early picks
   - **Solution**: Build in injury probability discount for key players

4. **Weather Forecasts**:
   - Check Sunday weather forecasts on Tuesday
   - Discount passing-heavy favorites in predicted bad weather
   - Field might not consider weather if picking early

5. **Betting Market Signals**:
   - Track line movement Tuesday → Sunday
   - If line moves significantly, sharp money knows something
   - Adjust accordingly (or flag for review)

**Meta-Question**: Does the field even know you're using advanced analytics?
- If yes: They might try to counter-predict your strategy
- If no: Your edge compounds over time

---

### Q13: League Dynamics & Meta-Game
**Question**: How does your strategy affect the league equilibrium?

**Game Theory Consideration**:

1. **If Everyone Uses Chalk**:
   - All tie on chalk wins
   - Only differentiation is chalk losses
   - Variance increases, skill decreases
   - **Response**: Moderate contrarian becomes +EV

2. **If You Dominate**:
   - Others might copy your strategy
   - Your edge diminishes
   - Arms race begins
   - **Response**: Need to stay ahead with better data

3. **Nash Equilibrium**:
   - In a 32-player pool with this field composition
   - What's the game-theoretically optimal strategy mix?
   - Your current answer: "Mostly chalk" (16/31 use it)
   - But is this actually equilibrium or exploitable?

4. **Kingmaker Dynamics**:
   - Late in season, are players optimizing for 1st place or top-3?
   - If someone is way ahead, do others team up (implicitly) to beat them?
   - This would show as coordinated contrarian picks

**Test**:
- Simulate Nash equilibrium with current field composition
- Compare to your Chalk strategy
- See if there's a better response

---

### Q14: Confidence Point Inflation/Deflation
**Question**: Is the 1-16 confidence scale optimal?

**Alternative Confidence Schemes**:

1. **Non-Linear Confidence**:
   - What if you could assign: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 (Fibonacci)?
   - Weight high-confidence picks more heavily
   - Would require league rule change, but interesting to model

2. **Cluster Confidence**:
   - Group 1 (High): 13-16 (4 games)
   - Group 2 (Medium): 7-12 (6 games)
   - Group 3 (Low): 1-6 (6 games)
   - Optimize confidence within groups based on differentiation, not just probability

3. **Relative Confidence vs Absolute**:
   - Current: Assign based on absolute win probability
   - Alternative: Assign based on edge over field
   - Example: 75% favorite with 100% field consensus → low value → lower confidence
   - Example: 60% favorite with 40% field consensus → high value → higher confidence

**Implementation**:
Test in Monte Carlo: Does clustering or relative confidence improve expected points?

---

### Q15: Injury/Suspension Database
**Question**: Can we quantify key player impact systematically?

**Approach**:
1. Maintain database of "high-impact" players per team:
   - QB, WR1, Edge rusher, CB1
   - Assign impact values: QB = -8% win prob, WR1 = -3%, etc.

2. Check injury reports Tuesday AM (before picks):
   - If QB questionable → reduce favorite probability by 4% (half impact)
   - If QB out → reduce by 8% (full impact)

3. Adjust confidence assignment based on modified probabilities

**Data Sources**:
- Official NFL injury reports (Wednesday updates too late for you)
- Beat reporter Twitter (real-time but noisy)
- Historical impact analysis (how much does Team X drop without Player Y?)

**Example**:
- Lions are 81% favorite with Jared Goff healthy
- Tuesday: Goff questionable (shoulder)
- Historical: Lions without Goff are -6% win prob
- Adjusted: 75% favorite
- Action: Reduce confidence from 13 → 11, bump other picks

---

### Q16: Opponent-Specific Modeling
**Question**: Can we build models for individual competitors?

**Approach**:
- 31 opponents, each with different strategies
- Instead of STRATEGY_MIX (16/14/1), model each player individually
- Predict each player's picks and confidence levels
- Run Monte Carlo against these 31 specific opponents

**Player Profiles**:
```python
player_models = {
    'Player A': {
        'strategy': 'Slight-Contrarian',
        'contrarian_rate': 0.188,
        'avg_contrarian_conf': 8.2,
        'risk_tolerance': 'medium',
        'home_bias': 0.05,  # Slightly favors home teams
        'recency_weight': 0.3  # Moderately affected by last week
    },
    'Player B': {
        'strategy': 'Chalk',
        'contrarian_rate': 0.016,
        'risk_tolerance': 'low',
        # ... etc
    }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- More accurate field simulation
- Identify which opponents are most dangerous (highest avg points/week)
- Optimize differentiation against specific threats

**Complexity**:
- High effort, marginal benefit
- Only valuable if you can predict individual behavior accurately
- Probably overkill for a 32-person pool

---

### Q17: Bonus Point Optimization
**Question**: Are we optimizing for the right objective?

**Current Objective**: Maximize expected total points (base + bonuses)

**Alternative Objectives**:

1. **Maximize P(Win League)**:
   - Different from maximizing expected points
   - Might favor higher-variance strategies
   - Example: If you're behind, aggressive-contrarian might have lower EV but higher P(come back)

2. **Maximize P(Top 3)** (if there are prizes for top 3):
   - Changes risk calculus
   - Might accept lower expected value for lower variance

3. **Maximize P(Get Bonuses)**:
   - Most Wins bonus: +5 points
   - Most Points bonus: +10 points
   - Should you explicitly optimize for these?
   - Example: Prioritize getting 12+ wins (for Most Wins) even if slightly -EV

4. **Bankroll Management**:
   - If this is a buy-in pool, Kelly criterion applies
   - Optimal bet size ≠ maximize expected value
   - Optimal bet size = maximize log(wealth)
   - Might suggest more conservative picks than pure EV maximization

**Test**:
Run simulations optimizing for different objectives, compare results

---

### Q18: Social/Collusion Detection
**Question**: Are there implicit alliances or information sharing?

**Patterns to Watch**:
1. Do certain players always make similar picks?
2. Are there family groups that might discuss strategy?
3. Do picks cluster more than randomness would suggest?

**Test**:
```python
def detect_collusion(picks_by_player, week):
    """
    Measure pick correlation between players.
    High correlation might indicate information sharing.
    """
    from scipy.stats import pearsonr

    correlations = {}
    for player1 in picks_by_player:
        for player2 in picks_by_player:
            if player1 >= player2:
                continue

            # Convert picks to vectors
            vec1 = picks_to_vector(picks_by_player[player1])
            vec2 = picks_to_vector(picks_by_player[player2])

            corr, p_value = pearsonr(vec1, vec2)

            if corr > 0.9:  # Very high correlation
                correlations[(player1, player2)] = corr

    return correlations
```

**Implications**:
- If players are colluding, they're essentially forming a "super-player"
- You need to differentiate from the coalition, not individual players
- Might change optimal strategy

---

### Q19: Seasonal Arc Considerations
**Question**: Does strategy change as season progresses?

**Early Season** (Weeks 1-4):
- High uncertainty in team quality
- Preseason rankings still matter
- Betting markets less efficient
- More variance in outcomes

**Mid Season** (Weeks 5-12):
- True team quality emerges
- Betting markets very efficient
- Less variance
- Optimal time for chalk strategy

**Late Season** (Weeks 13-18):
- Playoff implications affect motivation
- Teams resting starters
- Weather becomes factor (cold, snow)
- More variance again

**Implications**:
- Maybe early/late season favor slight-contrarian
- Mid-season favors chalk
- Adjust STRATEGY_MIX expectations based on week number

---

### Q20: The "Chaos" Strategy
**Question**: What if you intentionally maximize variance?

**Scenario**: You're in 15th place, Week 16, unlikely to win without extreme luck

**Chaos Strategy**:
- Pick 3-4 huge underdogs (25-35% win prob)
- Assign them high confidence (10-13)
- If they hit, you leapfrog everyone
- If they miss, you were going to lose anyway

**Math**:
- P(all 4 underdogs win) = 0.30^4 = 0.81% (unlikely)
- But EV of placing 1st >> EV of placing 15th
- Optimal play in desperate situations

**Game Theory**:
- This is unexploitable by field (they can't predict chaos)
- Only viable when you have nothing to lose
- Tournament poker equivalent of "chip and a chair"

**Implementation**:
Monitor your standing, if falling behind mid-season, activate chaos mode

**Highest Upside Ideas**:
1. **Q10 (Line Movement)**: Low effort, potential edge detection
2. **Q15 (Injury Database)**: Systematic edge if field doesn't adjust
3. **Q9 (Behavioral Bias)**: Exploitable if detectable
4. **Q11 (Weather Correlation)**: Easy to check, potential impact

**Most Interesting Philosophically**:
1. **Q13 (Nash Equilibrium)**: What is the "true" optimal strategy?
2. **Q17 (Objective Functions)**: Are we optimizing the right thing?
3. **Q20 (Chaos Strategy)**: When to abandon EV for variance

**Probably Overthinking**:
1. **Q16 (Individual Models)**: Too complex for marginal benefit
2. **Q18 (Collusion Detection)**: Interesting but not actionable

## Machine Learning Applications

### Q21: Supervised Learning for Win Probability
**Question**: Can ML models beat betting market probabilities?

**Current Approach**: Use de-vigged odds from The Odds API (market consensus)

**ML Alternative**: Train model to predict game outcomes directly

**Features** (per game):
```python
features = {
    # Team quality metrics
    'home_elo': 1650,
    'away_elo': 1580,
    'home_dvoa_offense': 0.15,
    'away_dvoa_defense': -0.08,
    'home_epa_per_play': 0.12,

    # Recent performance
    'home_last_3_wins': 2,
    'away_last_3_wins': 1,
    'home_points_per_game_l3': 28.3,
    'away_points_allowed_l3': 24.1,

    # Matchup specific
    'spread': -6.5,
    'total': 47.5,
    'home_advantage': 2.5,

    # Situational
    'rest_days_home': 7,
    'rest_days_away': 6,
    'travel_distance': 1200,
    'is_divisional': 0,
    'is_primetime': 1,

    # Weather (if available)
    'wind_mph': 12,
    'temp_f': 45,
    'precipitation_prob': 0.3
}
```

**Model Options**:
1. **Logistic Regression** (baseline, interpretable)
2. **XGBoost** (tree-based, good for tabular data)
3. **Neural Network** (can capture complex interactions)
4. **Ensemble** (combine multiple models)

**Training Data**:
- Historical NFL games (2015-2024 = ~2,500 games)
- Features available at Tuesday AM (before picks due)
- Binary outcome: home team win/loss

**Evaluation**:
- Compare Brier score vs betting markets
- If ML model Brier score < market Brier score → use ML
- If ML ≈ market → stick with market (more efficient, less maintenance)

**Reality Check**:
- Betting markets are VERY efficient (sharp bettors, billions in volume)
- Beating the market consistently is extremely hard
- **Expected outcome**: ML ≈ market, not better
- **Value**: Mainly as validation of market probabilities

**Implementation Effort**: High (data collection, feature engineering, model training)

**Expected Benefit**: Low (unlikely to beat market)

**Recommendation**: Skip unless you have unique data sources

---

### Q22: Opponent Pick Prediction (Classification)
**Question**: Can we predict what each opponent will pick?

**Problem**: Field picks become available Tuesday PM, but you pick Tuesday AM

**Solution**: Train classifier to predict each player's picks before they make them

**Approach**:

**For each player, for each game, predict**:
```python
# Binary classification per game
will_player_pick_favorite = True/False

# Multi-class if predicting confidence
predicted_confidence = 1-16
```

**Features** (per player, per game):
```python
player_features = {
    # Player characteristics (from historical data)
    'player_contrarian_rate': 0.188,
    'player_avg_conf_on_favorites': 8.5,
    'player_risk_tolerance': 'medium',
    'player_home_bias': 0.05,

    # Game characteristics
    'favorite_prob': 0.75,
    'spread': -6.5,
    'is_primetime': 1,
    'favorite_brand_value': 0.8,  # Cowboys, Chiefs high

    # Interaction features
    'prob_above_player_threshold': 1,  # 75% > player's 65% threshold
    'field_consensus_last_week': 0.85,  # Historical field behavior
}
```

**Target**: Binary per player per game (did they pick favorite?)

**Training Data**:
- Weeks 1-4: 31 players × 64 games = 1,984 observations
- Not much data, but could work

**Model Options**:
1. **Logistic Regression** (per player, simple)
2. **Random Forest** (handles interactions well)
3. **Neural Network** (if enough data)

**Evaluation**:
- Accuracy: % of picks predicted correctly
- Need >70% accuracy to be useful
- Test: Train on Weeks 1-3, predict Week 4, check accuracy

**Use Case**:
- Predict Week N field composition before picks visible
- Run contrarian analyzer with predicted field
- Identify opportunities earlier

**Challenges**:
1. **Sample size**: Only 4 weeks (64 games) - not much training data
2. **Concept drift**: Players might change strategies
3. **Overfitting risk**: 31 separate models with limited data

**Practical Test**:
```python
def evaluate_opponent_prediction():
    # Train on Weeks 1-3
    train_data = load_weeks([1, 2, 3])

    # For each player, train classifier
    models = {}
    for player in get_players():
        X_train = build_features(train_data, player)
        y_train = get_picks(train_data, player)
        models[player] = LogisticRegression().fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Predict Week 4
    test_data = load_week(4)
    predictions = {}
    for player in get_players():
        X_test = build_features(test_data, player)
        predictions[player] = models[player].predict(X_test)

    # Check accuracy
    actual_picks = get_actual_picks(4)
    accuracy = calculate_accuracy(predictions, actual_picks)

    return accuracy  # Need >70% to be useful
```

**Expected Benefit**: Medium (if accuracy >70%, enables earlier contrarian analysis)

**Implementation Effort**: Medium (feature engineering, but straightforward ML)

**Recommendation**: Worth testing on Weeks 1-4 data

---

### Q23: Confidence Level Prediction (Regression)
**Question**: Can we predict not just picks, but confidence levels?

**Extension of Q22**: Instead of binary (favorite/dog), predict confidence 1-16

**Model**: Regression per player
```python
# For each player
y = predicted_confidence (1-16)
X = [game_features, player_features, historical_patterns]
```

**Features** (in addition to Q22):
```python
confidence_features = {
    # Game strength signals
    'favorite_prob': 0.81,
    'spread': -9.5,
    'field_avg_conf_last_week': 11.2,  # Historical for similar games

    # Player patterns
    'player_max_conf_used': 0,  # Have they used 16 yet this week?
    'player_remaining_high_conf': [13, 14, 15, 16],
    'player_conf_on_similar_prob_historically': 8.5,
}
```

**Challenge**: Confidence is constrained (must use each 1-16 exactly once)
- Can't predict independently
- Need to predict ranking/ordering, not absolute values

**Better Approach**: Predict relative ranking
```python
# Predict: will this game be in player's top 3 confidence picks?
is_top_3_confidence = True/False
is_top_5_confidence = True/False
# etc.
```

**Use Case**:
- More nuanced field prediction
- Better EV calculation for contrarian opportunities
- Example: "28 opponents will pick DET with avg confidence 12.5"

**Expected Benefit**: Low (pick prediction alone is enough for most analysis)

**Recommendation**: Skip unless pick prediction (Q22) shows >80% accuracy

---

### Q24: Ensemble Meta-Strategy Selection
**Question**: Which strategy should you use each week?

**Current Approach**: Always use Chalk (based on historical average performance)

**ML Approach**: Predict which strategy will perform best THIS week

**Setup**:
- Target: Which strategy scored most points (Chalk, Slight, Aggressive, Shuffle)
- Features: Game slate characteristics

**Features** (per week):
```python
week_features = {
    # Probability distribution
    'avg_favorite_prob': 0.68,
    'stdev_favorite_prob': 0.12,
    'num_tossups': 4,  # 45-55% games
    'num_heavy_favorites': 3,  # >80% games

    # Betting market signals
    'avg_spread': 5.2,
    'max_spread': 14.0,
    'total_market_uncertainty': 0.15,  # Implied volatility

    # Situational
    'num_divisional_games': 5,
    'num_primetime_games': 2,
    'week_number': 5,

    # Historical context
    'chalk_weeks_in_row': 2,  # Mean reversion signal?
    'upset_rate_last_2_weeks': 0.35,
}
```

**Target**: Best performing strategy (categorical)

**Model**: Multi-class classifier
- Random Forest or XGBoost
- Outputs: P(Chalk best), P(Slight best), P(Aggressive best), P(Shuffle best)

**Training Data**:
- Need multiple seasons (4 weeks not enough)
- Ideally 3-5 years × 18 weeks = 54-90 observations

**Evaluation**:
- Accuracy: % of weeks where predicted best strategy = actual best
- Expected value gain vs always using Chalk

**Reality Check**:
- Chalk wins 71.4% of time in your data
- Would need strong signal to switch
- Likely needs more data (multiple seasons)

**Recommendation**: Defer until you have 2+ seasons of data

---

### Q25: Anomaly Detection for "Trap Games"
**Question**: Can we identify games where betting markets are wrong?

**Concept**: "Trap game" = market overvalues favorite, underdog has hidden value

**Approach**: Anomaly detection on game features

**Features**:
```python
game_features = {
    # Market signals
    'opening_line': -7.0,
    'closing_line': -9.5,  # Line movement = public on favorite
    'line_movement': -2.5,
    'betting_splits': 0.85,  # 85% of bets on favorite
    'money_splits': 0.60,    # But only 60% of money (sharp on dog)

    # Team context
    'favorite_ats_last_5': 0.20,  # 1-4 ATS (public overvaluing?)
    'underdog_ats_last_5': 0.80,  # 4-1 ATS (undervalued?)
    'favorite_days_rest': 6,
    'underdog_days_rest': 10,     # Extra rest = hidden advantage

    # Situational
    'favorite_coming_off_big_win': 1,  # Letdown spot?
    'underdog_revenge_game': 1,        # Motivation factor
    'public_perception_gap': 0.3,      # Brand name bias
}
```

**Model**: Isolation Forest or One-Class SVM
- Flag games with unusual feature combinations
- These might be market inefficiencies

**Validation**:
- Do flagged "trap games" have higher upset rates?
- Historical test: Flag games in Weeks 1-3, check Week 4 outcomes

**Expected Benefit**: Low (betting markets are efficient, "trap game" theory is mostly narrative)

**Recommendation**: Interesting research question, but low priority

---

### Q26: Reinforcement Learning for Sequential Decision Making
**Question**: Can RL learn optimal strategy through self-play?

**Setup**: Frame as multi-armed bandit or Markov Decision Process

**State**:
- Current game slate (probabilities, spreads)
- Your current season standing
- Field composition
- Games remaining in season

**Actions**:
- Choose strategy (Chalk, Slight, Aggressive, Shuffle, Custom)
- Or: choose picks + confidence levels directly

**Reward**:
- Points scored this week
- Season-end placement (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.)

**Approach**:
1. **Contextual Bandit**:
   - Context = game slate features
   - Action = strategy choice
   - Reward = points scored
   - Learn: Which strategy works best for which contexts?

2. **Deep Q-Learning**:
   - State = full game slate + season context
   - Action = confidence assignment for all 16 games
   - Reward = expected placement
   - Learn: Optimal pick strategy through simulation

3. **Self-Play**:
   - Simulate 32-player leagues
   - Each agent learns optimal strategy
   - Converge to Nash equilibrium

**Challenges**:
1. **Sample efficiency**: RL needs LOTS of data (thousands of weeks)
2. **Sparse rewards**: Only get signal at end of week/season
3. **Non-stationary**: Opponents' strategies might change
4. **Simulation accuracy**: RL only as good as simulator

**Reality Check**:
- Your Monte Carlo approach already finds near-optimal strategy
- RL would need to rediscover "Chalk is best" through trial/error
- Unlikely to outperform analytical approach

**Expected Benefit**: Low (existing Monte Carlo is more sample-efficient)

**Recommendation**: Cool in theory, impractical in reality

---

### Q27: Transfer Learning from Other Prediction Markets
**Question**: Can we learn from other prediction markets to improve NFL predictions?

**Idea**: NFL outcomes correlate with other markets
- NBA (team management quality)
- College football (pipeline to NFL)
- Futures markets (team quality signals)

**Example**:
- If team's Super Bowl odds improve significantly → team undervalued in week-to-week markets
- If team's draft position odds worsen → team giving up, overvalued as favorite

**Transfer Learning Approach**:
1. Pre-train model on related prediction tasks
2. Fine-tune on NFL game predictions
3. Hope shared representations improve performance

**Reality Check**:
- NFL game outcomes are mostly independent
- Correlation with other markets likely weak
- Transfer learning benefit minimal

**Recommendation**: Too speculative, skip

---

### Q28: Natural Language Processing for Injury/News Signals
**Question**: Can we extract signals from news, Twitter, beat reporters?

**Approach**: NLP on text data

**Sources**:
- Beat reporter Twitter accounts
- Injury report analysis (official + unofficial)
- Coach press conferences
- Reddit game threads
- Sports news headlines

**Signals to Extract**:
```python
nlp_features = {
    'qb_health_sentiment': 0.3,  # "Questionable" vs "Probable"
    'coach_confidence_score': 0.7,  # Analyze presser tone
    'insider_buzz': 0.5,  # Twitter chatter volume
    'injury_severity': 'moderate',  # "Day to day" vs "Week to week"
}
```

**Model**:
- BERT/GPT for sentiment analysis
- Named Entity Recognition for player mentions
- Topic modeling for injury news

**Challenges**:
1. **Noise**: Most Twitter is garbage
2. **Timing**: News breaks Wednesday-Sunday, you pick Tuesday
3. **Validation**: Hard to measure impact of "sentiment"
4. **Effort**: High (NLP pipeline, data collection)

**Expected Benefit**: Low (signal likely already in betting lines)

**Recommendation**: Only if you enjoy NLP, not for competitive edge

---

## The Honest ML Assessment

**Question**: Will ML dramatically improve your confidence pool performance?

**Answer**: Probably not.

**Why**:
1. **Betting markets are efficient**: Hard to beat consensus probabilities
2. **Sample size issues**: Only 16-18 weeks per season, not enough for complex ML
3. **Your current approach is sound**: De-vigged odds + Monte Carlo is near-optimal
4. **The edge is in execution**: Process (timing, game validation) > algorithms

**Where ML Could Help**:
1. **Opponent modeling (Q22)**: Predicting field picks before they're public
2. **Probability validation (Q21)**: Sanity checking market odds
3. **Feature discovery (Q25)**: Finding systematic biases in field behavior

**Best Use of ML**:
- Start simple: Logistic regression for opponent picks
- If accuracy >70%, incorporate into contrarian analyzer
- Don't overcomplicate: Simpler models often win in small-data regimes

**Bottom Line**:
The simulator you built is fundamentally sound. ML might add 1-2 points per season. Process improvements (game validation, injury tracking) likely worth more.
